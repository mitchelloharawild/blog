<p>The v0.2.0 update to the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/vitae/">vitae package</a> is now available on CRAN, and along with it comes with new templates and more features. Read on to learn more, or refer to the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/vitae/news/index.html">changelog</a> for a brief summary.</p>
<div id="new-templates-and-themes" class="section level1">
<h1>New templates and themes</h1>
<p>This release introduces 5 new styles ready for you to try with your vitae. Theme
support for <a href="https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv">moderncv</a> has been added,
allowing you to choose between <code>casual</code> (default), <code>classic</code>, <code>oldstyle</code>,
<code>banking</code> and <code>fancy</code>. Themes for <code>moderncv</code> are specified in the YAML header:</p>
<pre><code>output: 
  vitae::moderncv:
    theme: classic</code></pre>
<p>Newly added is the classic theme from the <a href="https://github.com/jankapunkt/latexcv">latexcv</a>
template is now available using the <code>vitae::latexcv</code> output format. Other themes
from this template will be added in a future version (contributions welcomed).</p>
<p>If you’d like to contribute a new template to the vitae package, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/vitae/articles/extending.html"><em>creating vitae templates</em></a> vignette.</p>
</div>
<div id="improvements" class="section level1">
<h1>Improvements</h1>
<p>This update includes a few incremental improvements. For those creating a new
CV you’ll now start from a more complete example of a vitae that features usage
of <code>brief_entries()</code>, <code>detailed_entries()</code> and <code>bibliography_entries()</code>. We hope
that this will make it easier for you to see how each of these functions work,
giving you a quick start to making your own résumé.</p>
<p>We’ve also added two new arguments for the YAML header. <code>docname</code> can be used to
modify the “Curriculum Vitae” or “Résumé” text that exists in the template. We’ve
also added <code>surname</code>, which allows special template formatting (output for the
<code>name</code> remains unchanged).</p>
<p>Speaking of surnames, this field will now appear in the dataset returned by
<code>bibliography_entries()</code>. This is particularly useful for the improvements made
to sorting bibliography entries, as they will now respect the order from the data.</p>
<p>Lastly there is a new <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/vitae/articles/data.html"><em>data sources for vitae</em></a>
vignette, which highlights a few useful approaches to getting data into your CV.</p>
</div>
<div id="breaking-changes" class="section level1">
<h1>Breaking changes</h1>
<p>Unfortunately we didn’t get the interface for <code>bibliography_entries()</code> exactly right in the first version. We have decided that the <code>title</code> and <code>sorting</code> are not required and have deprecated them.</p>
<p>The <code>sorting</code> argument was a common source of confusion for users that are unfamiliar the sorting interface for LaTeX’s biblatex. Instead, we now use the order of entries in the tibble returned by <code>bibliography_entries()</code>, which allows you to use <code>dplyr::arrange()</code> to re-order the entries to suit your needs. Instead of using the <code>title</code> argument, we now recommend that you use markdown headers.</p>
