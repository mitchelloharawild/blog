<p><img src="/blog/2019-01-09-vitae_files/vitae.png" style="float:right"/> For those looking to refresh their CV this year, the <a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/vitae/">vitae package</a> may offer a convenient and maintainable solution. The package leverages the power of <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown’s dynamic documents</a> to help you create, maintain, and even automate your Résumé or CV. The package provides a growing collection of popular CV templates, with simple data-driven functions add entries such as your education, experiences, and accolades. As the CV entries can be generated from data, it integrates well with existing and future R packages. This allows you to programatically filter your CV experiences to be more relevant for each job, and automatically download your qualifications or work experience from the web.</p>
<p>The project began at the <a href="https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/">2018 rOpenSci OzUnconf</a>, where R users of all levels of expertise came together to build <a href="http://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/projects/">thirteen packages and one guide</a>. Many of the participants had never developed an R package before, and had no experience with collaborative programming with git. Those interested in this great event should read Nicholas Tierney’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/nj_tierney/">@nj_tierney</a>) recap on the rOpenSci blog: <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/08/ozunconf18/"><em>Continuing to Grow Community Together at ozunconf, 2018</em></a>.</p>
<p>The resulting package is the result of many <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf18/issues/24">ideas and discussions</a> from participants of the unconference, and was primarily implemented by myself (<a href="https://twitter.com/mitchoharawild">@mitchoharawild</a>) and Rob Hyndman (<a href="https://twitter.com/robjhyndman">@robjhyndman</a>). An early realisation was that we each had slightly different pronunciations for <em>vitae</em>, and to our astonishment we were all wrong! It’s supposed to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uEJDQAUgJk">pronounced <em>/ˈviːteɪ/</em></a>, as in <em>vee-tie</em>, because it is a Latin expression - who knew?</p>
<p>As of today, the vitae package is now available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=vitae">CRAN</a>. Is it time to update your CV? Get started with the package by reading the <a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/vitae/articles/vitae.html"><em>introduction to vitae</em></a>. Also, look out for a blog post tomorrow on the <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/">rOpenSci blog</a> about the design decisions around vitae, and some examples of how it can be used to quickly create your next CV.</p>
